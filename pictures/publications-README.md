# Publication Images

This folder should contain thumbnail images of your publications' first pages.

## How to Add Publication Images

1. Take a screenshot of the first page of your published paper
2. Save it as a JPG file (e.g., `pub_2025_transportation.jpg`)
3. Update the `src` attribute in the publications HTML to point to your image
4. Recommended size: 150x200 pixels (portrait format)

## Automatic Image Fetching

The website can also try to fetch publication images automatically from journal websites like:
- ScienceDirect
- PubMed
- Journal websites

Simply provide the DOI or direct link to the publication.

## Default Image

If no specific image is available, a placeholder image will be shown.
